# Guessing Game

For this project from my Windows Programming (CMPE 361) course, JavaFX & Eclipse were used to build an application that contains two tabs for two different games:
- The first game is titled "Guess The Number", where the user must guess the randomly generated number between 0 and 100. If the player gives up, they can click a button to reveal the correct answer. If the player does the latter or correctly guesses the number, a pop-up window will appear, prompting them to continue or quit the game.
- The second game is called "Math Quiz Game", where the player must enter their username and select the right answer for the equation ax = b where a is a number between 0 and 10, and b is a multiple of a. The advanced version consists of a being between the range of 11 & 100. The player can also customize the font size and theme of the game.
